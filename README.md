About
---

Another program I created because of an job interview. The task was to parse a Markdown file
to HTML in an hour. When I was in the interview I started using Haskell but rejected the idea due a
lack of time. A day after the interview I wanted to prove for myself that I'm able to solve the task
by using Haskell.
Obviously this was done a dozen times and often better than my implementation. Nevertheless it is a
good task to intensify my parsing skills in Haskell :)
